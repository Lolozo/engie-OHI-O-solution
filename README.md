# engie-OHI-O-solution

For our project, we watned to focus on the 7th goal of the Resource Stewardship University Sustainability goals for Ohio State. The 7th goal is "Develop university-wide standards for targeted environmentally preferred products and fully implement preferabl products and services by 2025". 

We decided that instead of building off of the current sustainability plan Ohio State has, we wanted to create out own plan and set of initiatives for the university to take. Although this is a lot more work and we need to cover a lot more bases, we believe this is easier to accomplish as it allows us more freedom to come up goals and initiatives.
